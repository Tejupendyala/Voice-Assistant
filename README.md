# Voice-Assistant

This Python script implements a basic voice assistant capable of performing simple tasks based on voice commands. The assistant responds to common greetings like "Hello" with predefined responses, tells the current time or date upon request, and can perform basic web searches for information based on user queries. Features

Greeting Responses:
When the user says "Hello" or a similar greeting, the assistant responds with a predefined friendly message.
Time and Date Information:
Upon receiving a command like "What's the time?" or "Tell me the date," the assistant provides the current time or date.
Web Search:
The assistant can search the web for information based on user queries. For example, saying "Search for Python programming" triggers a web search for information on Python programming.
